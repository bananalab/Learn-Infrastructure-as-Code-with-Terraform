# Set up your development environment.

## Code editor
Like most development environments Terraform is completely text based.  Therefore you will need a text editor.  In this class we'll be using Microsoft VSCode.

Install:

Plugins can be installed from the VSCode Marketplace, or from within VSCode itself. 
    
- [Hashicorp HCL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.HCL)
- [Hashicorp Terraform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform)

> ðŸ“˜ There are other plugins available for Terraform development, but these are the official Hashicorp versions.

## Other tools.
There is an ecosystem of tools to help develop Terraform code.  We'll be using a few of these, but they're all worth checking out.

> ðŸ“˜ These can be installed on systems that support [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (MacOS, Linux, WSL).

## Install Terraform
Even though you have installed a lot of tools, Terraform itself is not installed yet.
To install it run:

`tfenv install latest`

> ðŸš§ tfenv may not work on Windows.  Instead you can download terraform binaries here: https://www.terraform.io/downloads

Now that Terraform is installed you can begin exploring it.

Try `terraform help` to see what commands are available.

Run `terraform apply`  What happens?
> ðŸ“˜ We'll be exploring a lot of these in detail throughout the course, but feel free to ask if any commands pique your interest.

> ðŸ“˜ typing `terraform` at the prompt gets tedious quickly.  Try adding an alias `tf=terraform` using your shell's aliasing mechanism.

## Check your AWS settings.
> ðŸ“˜ A full walk through of setting up AWS accounts is outside the scope of the training, but you should be able to run:

`aws sts get-caller-identity`

to verify it's configured as you expect.
